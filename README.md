The preprocessor `prep` is a `C++14` port of Bell Lab's `Plan9` C preprocessor  [`cpp`](http://9p.io/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/cpp/), hence I give the
due authorship credits to the original authors.
This port is aimed at converting the original `Plan9's C dialect` implementation to `C++14` and making it more strictly typed (`C++` helps here to circumvent `C`'s lenient type system).

In praise of the `Plan9`'s `cpp` codebase, It's perhaps the best open source C codebase I've laid my eyes on in terms of readability! No thousand line
copyright notices polluting each source file (like most GNU sources), no doxygen comments littered all over the place. This made comprehending and porting way convenient. :)
