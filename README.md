# ___`prep`___

----------------
- The preprocessor `prep` is a `C++14` port of Bell Lab's `Plan9` C preprocessor  [`cpp`](http://9p.io/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/cpp/), hence I give the
due authorship credits to the original authors.

- This port is aimed at converting the original `Plan9's C dialect` implementation to `C++14` and making it more strictly typed (`C++` helps here to circumvent the shortcomings of `C`'s lenient type system).
